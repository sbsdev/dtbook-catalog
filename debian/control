Description: Digital Talking Book Document Type Definition (DTD)
 The Digital Talking Book Document Type Definition (DTD) provides
 the means to mark up the text of a document to permit support for
 the combination of professional narration and navigation into that
 narration. It also facilitates the output of a document's content in
 a variety of accessible formats. The markup tags in the book convey
 its content in structure, and contain some metadata about the book
 content and its structure.
